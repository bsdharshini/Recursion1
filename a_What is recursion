What is recursion

- Calling a function from itself
- Base case + Assumption + Proof
- Mathematics behind recursion is PMI - principle of mathematical induction
- Step by step process: 

1)  we must add a base conditionto stop the recursion
2)  Break the problem into small parts(assumption)
3)  Then apply for n (*) small parts
